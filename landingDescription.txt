The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as one gets closer to the equator. To accomplish this analysis, we first pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on over 500 cities. 

After assembling the dataset, we used Matpotlib to plot various aspects of the weather vs. latituse. Factors we looked at included: temperature, cloudieness, windspeed, and humidity. This site provides the source data and vizualizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explainations and descriptions of any trends and correlations witnessed.

The following table includes all of the data used for plotting during this project. 

As expected, the weather becomes significantly warmer as one approaches the equator(0 Deg. Latitude). More interestingly, however, it is a fact that the southern hemisphere tends to be warmer than the northern hemisphere this time of year. This may be due to the the current eason at the time of data collection. 


There are sprinkles of high levels of humidity across all latitudes, but it seems as there are more humidity in the northern hemisphere, but could be due to just the higher number of cities in our sample from the northern hemisphere.


It is difficult to see any clear patterns in the cloudiness vs. latitude readings. Some trends are: there are a large number of cities across latitudes that experienced 0% cloudieness, there are also more observations of clouds at the highest latitudes than at the lowest latitudes.

The majority of cities in our sample have wind speed ranging from 0-20 mph, but there are a couple of outliers that experienced wind speed in excess of 20 mph. And only 4 cities have experienced more than 30 mph!
